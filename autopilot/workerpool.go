// workerPool contains all workers known to the autopilot.  Users can call
// withWorker to execute a function with a worker of the pool or withWorkers to
// sequentially run a function on all workers.  Due to the RWMutex this will
// never block during normal operations. However, during an update of the
// workerpool, this allows us to guarantee that all workers have finished their
// tasks by calling  acquiring an exclusive lock on the pool before updating it.
// That way the caller who updated the pool can rely on the autopilot not using
// a worker that was removed during the update after the update operation
// returns.
